# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that allows users to input a city name and retrieve real-time weather information such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed for the specified city. The app fetches the weather data from an external API and displays it to the user in an easy-to-read format.

## Features

- User inputs a city name.
- Displays the current temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit).
- Displays the current humidity.
- Displays the current wind speed.
- Displays weather condition (clear, rainy, etc.).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS** for the frontend
- **JavaScript** for the logic and API interaction.
- **Weather API** for fetching weather data (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

## Getting Started

To get this project running locally, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- A text editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
- An API key for the weather service (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API).

### Steps to Obtain an API Key from OpenWeatherMap

Visit the OpenWeatherMap Website

Open your web browser and go to the OpenWeatherMap website.
Create an Account or Log In

If you don’t have an account, click on Sign Up in the top-right corner and create an account using your email address.
If you already have an account, click on Sign In to log into your existing account.
Navigate to the API Section

Once logged in, go to the API section. You can find it by clicking on API in the top menu or by visiting https://openweathermap.org/api.
Choose the API Plan

OpenWeatherMap offers several different API plans (e.g., Free, Paid). The Free Tier is generally sufficient for most basic weather apps.
To use the free plan, scroll down and select the "Current Weather Data" API, which provides current weather information for any city in the world.
You can choose other APIs based on your project needs, such as forecasts or historical data.
Get Your API Key

After choosing the API you need, click on the "Get API Key" or "Subscribe" button.
You will be redirected to the API subscription page. If you're using the free tier, the subscription will be free of charge.
Your API key should be visible in your account dashboard once you complete the sign-up process.
Copy the API Key

Once you've subscribed to the API, your personal API key will be displayed in your account dashboard or API key section.
Copy the API key — this is what you'll use to authenticate requests to OpenWeatherMap.
Use the API Key in Your Application

Now that you have the API key, you can use it in your project to make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
